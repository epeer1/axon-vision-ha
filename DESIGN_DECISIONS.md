## 1. Communication Method - Why ZeroMQ? {#communication-method}

### The Decision
We chose **ZeroMQ with platform-adaptive transport** for inter-process communication:
- **IPC sockets** on Linux/Unix for maximum performance
- **TCP sockets** on Windows (IPC not supported)
- Automatic detection with manual override option

### Why Not Other Options?

#### ❌ Python Multiprocessing Queues
- **Pros**: Built-in, no dependencies
- **Cons**: 
  - High serialization overhead for video frames
  - Limited to parent-child process relationships
  - Poor performance with large numpy arrays
- **Verdict**: Too slow for real-time video

#### ❌ Shared Memory
- **Pros**: Fastest possible data transfer
- **Cons**:
  - Complex synchronization required
  - Platform-specific implementations
  - Difficult to debug race conditions
- **Verdict**: Too complex for the timeline

#### ❌ Named Pipes (FIFOs)
- **Pros**: Simple concept
- **Cons**:
  - Platform differences (Windows vs Linux)
  - No built-in message framing
  - Blocking I/O issues
- **Verdict**: Not portable enough

#### ✅ ZeroMQ - Our Choice
- **Pros**:
  - Industry standard for video pipelines
  - Zero-copy message passing
  - Built-in message framing
  - Non-blocking operations
  - Automatic reconnection
  - Works identically on all platforms
- **Cons**:
  - External dependency
  - Slight learning curve
- **Verdict**: Best balance of performance and reliability

### Platform-Specific Adaptation
- **Smart Transport Selection**: Code automatically detects platform
- **IPC on Linux/Unix**: Uses `ipc://` for zero-copy, high-performance communication
- **TCP on Windows**: Falls back to `tcp://127.0.0.1:XXXX` (IPC not supported)
- **Environment Override**: `FORCE_TCP=true` to use TCP everywhere (useful for debugging)
- **No Code Changes**: Same application code works on all platforms

## 2. Architecture Decisions {#architecture-decisions}

### 5-Process Design
Instead of just the required 3 processes, we implemented 5:

1. **Video Streamer** - Reads and sends frames
2. **Motion Detector** - Analyzes frames
3. **Video Display** - Shows video with overlays
4. **Web Streamer** - Browser-based viewing
5. **Logging Service** - Centralized logging

**Why?**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each process has one clear responsibility
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more displays or processing nodes
- **Debugging**: Centralized logging makes troubleshooting easier
- **Modern Approach**: Web interface is standard in production systems

### Pipeline vs Star Topology
We chose a **linear pipeline** (Streamer → Detector → Display) over a star topology.

**Why?**
- Matches the assignment's data flow requirements
- Natural for video processing (each stage enhances the previous)
- Easier to reason about data dependencies
- Prevents race conditions between stages

## 3. Process Design Choices {#process-design}

### Subprocess Management
Used Python's `subprocess.Popen` with explicit process management.

**Why?**
- Fine-grained control over process lifecycle
- Ability to capture stdout/stderr
- Clean shutdown handling
- Platform-independent process spawning

### Graceful Shutdown Design
Implemented cascade shutdown: Streamer ends → Detector detects → Display stops → All cleanup

**Why?**
- Prevents data loss
- Ensures all frames are processed
- Clean resource deallocation
- No orphaned processes

### Error Handling Strategy
Each process has independent error handling with fallback behavior.

**Why?**
- Resilience: One component failure doesn't crash everything
- Debugging: Clear error messages per component
- Recovery: Processes can reconnect after temporary failures

## 4. Implementation Choices {#implementation-choices}

### OpenCV for Video Processing
Used cv2 (OpenCV) for all video operations.

**Why?**
- Industry standard for computer vision
- Excellent performance
- Rich feature set
- Cross-platform support

### Motion Detection Algorithm
Used frame differencing with threshold and dilation.

**Why?**
- Simple and effective
- Low computational cost
- Works well for the test video
- Easy to understand and debug

### Blur Implementation (Phase B)
Chose pixelation over Gaussian blur.

**Why?**
- More visually obvious (better for demo)
- Computationally efficient
- Preserves privacy better
- Distinctive visual effect

### Web Streaming Technology
Used Flask with MJPEG streaming.

**Why?**
- No client-side dependencies
- Works in any browser
- Simple to implement
- Good enough for local network

## 5. Performance Optimizations {#performance-optimizations}

### Frame Serialization
Used pickle protocol 5 with out-of-band buffers.

**Why?**
- Optimized for numpy arrays
- Reduces memory copies
- Faster than JSON/MessagePack for binary data
- Native Python support

### Queue Management
Implemented bounded queues with size limits.

**Why?**
- Prevents memory overflow
- Natural backpressure mechanism
- Predictable memory usage
- Handles slow consumers gracefully

### Threading Model
Each process uses minimal threading (main + ZMQ receiver thread).

**Why?**
- Avoids Python GIL issues
- Simpler than full async
- Sufficient for the pipeline needs
- Easier to debug

## 6. Phase-Specific Decisions {#phase-specific-decisions}

### Phase A - Core Pipeline
**Focus**: Stability and correct data flow
- Implemented comprehensive logging first
- Built robust IPC before adding features
- Prioritized smooth playback over features

### Phase B - Motion Blur
**Focus**: Visual feedback and performance
- Added blur as post-processing step
- Included visual indicator for clarity
- Made it toggleable for comparison

### Phase C - Automatic Shutdown
**Focus**: Clean lifecycle management
- Detected video end in streamer
- Propagated shutdown signal through pipeline
- Ensured proper cleanup order

## Summary

Every decision was made with these priorities:
1. **Correctness** - Must work reliably
2. **Performance** - Must handle real-time video
3. **Maintainability** - Must be easy to understand
4. **Portability** - Must work on Windows/Linux/Mac

The result is a production-grade pipeline that demonstrates professional software engineering practices while meeting all assignment requirements.
